# Genetic Programming Symbolic Regression

Repository for executing PySR-based tree-GP-like optimization on some benchmark datasets, plus several standard sklear-based ML models.

## Installation

Locally clone this repo, enter the folder of the repo, and create the environment directly from conda:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gpsr
```

Then, always from the terminal, type:


```sh
python3
```

Then, in the python shell, execute:

```python3
import pysr
```

and wait until it finishes. This enables to actually install the Julia packages needed to execute PySR.
